Variability of Spatiotemporal-Rhythmic Network during Inhibitory Control in Repetitive Subconcussion

This code library is used to calculate the Spatiotemporal-Rhythmic Network (STRN). The example_calculate_STRN.m file contains the code to compute the n:m phase synchronization index, which requires adding the EEGLAB toolbox to the MATLAB path. The example-STRN-state-dynamic-measures-code.m file is used to calculate three STRN dynamic measures: frequency of occurrence, mean dwell time, and number of state transitions.
